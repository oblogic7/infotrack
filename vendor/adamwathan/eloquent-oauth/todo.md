# To Do
- Remove hard dependency on Session\Store, replace with some sort of "CrossRequestPersistanceInterface" or something
- Look for more opportunities to add abstractions to different provider implementations. Had to do some crappy stuff with the LinkedIn provider.
- Twitter support, going to be interesting...
- Add some default scopes for each provider maybe? Need to think about it.
